The calculator program evaluates an expression that is given to it.

It works by converting the expression string from infix notation to postfix notation using the Shunting Yard algorithm.
Then it evaluates this postfix expression to give a result.

Currently this program supports multiplication, division, addition, subtraction as well as brackets.
It only works with single digit numbers although this is something I hope to change in the future.

I hope to continue with this project next week. 
New features will include:
    Multi-digit numbers
    Floating point numbers
    Exponents
    A lexer with useful error reporting

I have also created a custom stack datatype that represents a stack of tokens. I may also improve on this slightly as well.
However this was not the main focus of the project, just a requirement of the algorithms.
